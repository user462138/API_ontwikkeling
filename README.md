### Errata
* Page 20, "Some other popular frameworks include XML-RPC, **SOAP PRC**, JSON-RPC, and gRPC."  _it should be_  "Some other popular frameworks include XML-RPC, **SOAP RPC**, JSON-RPC, and gRPC."
* Page 39, Command for creating a web API project says
`dotnet new webapi -n MyFirstApi -controllers
cd MyFirstApi
code .`
_it should be_
